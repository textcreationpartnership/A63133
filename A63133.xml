            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A True and Exact ACCOUNT OF THE ROBBING OF King WILLIAM's Coaches AT KENSINTON, On <hi>Friday</hi> Night last, being the 18th of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>August.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>We have had frequent Accounts of Robberies of late committed near <hi>London,</hi> and elsewhere, and some of which not without most hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Murthers to boot: Notwithstanding so many Assizes there are in the year, and the strictness of the Law, made and provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such Vermin, still they rather augment than decrease, and are grown to that degree of Boldness, that they spare none, even from the Prince to the Peasant; the Defect whereof being Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to our Senators, in not taking due Care by finding Ways and Means to Employ all the Poor and idle Persons of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in some lawful Employments, whereby they may get an honest Livelihood: Which His Majesty was graciously pleased most ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>stly to urge to Both Houses of Parliament, at the beginning of the last Sessions. And 'tis generally taken notice of, that when they come to meet with Justice, they readily make their Reply, That Penury and Want was the Cause of their committing such Thefts and Outrages, and some again imply it for want of Trade. But to come to the Account of this late Robbery, committed at His Majesty's Royal Stables at <hi>Kensinton;</hi> 'Tis as follows.</p>
            <p>HIs Majesty's Stables not being often frequented by the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and other Servants belonging thereunto, by reason of His Majesty's Absence; But on <hi>Friday</hi> Morning last being the 18th instant, Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> having occasion for some Things that were in the Stable, sent a Messenger to fetch them, where he found three of the King's Coaches, and all Appurtenances thereto belonging, safe and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and accordingly left them; But on <hi>Friday</hi> Night last, an attempt was made by some evil disposed Persons, to break into the said Stables,
<pb facs="tcp:106390:1"/>which they effected in the following manner. The Stable having strong Leav'd Doors, above which are fixed strong Iron Bars very thick, the Felons (with a Knife or some other Instrument) cut a Hole in a Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, somewhat above the Door sideward, through which, as it is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, by the help of a Hook, they pull'd back the Bolt; the next Coach to the Door hapning to be a fine <hi>French</hi> Coach lin'd with Green, and rich Fringes, being a Present made to the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi>Portland,</hi> when he went over Embassadour Extraordinary from His <hi>Britanick</hi> Majesty, was pillag'd of all the Linings, Fringes and Cushions; the next was a fine Coach lin'd with Crimson, which they also ript off from the Top and sides, leaving only the Cushions, tumbled out of the Coach. 'Tis supposed the occasion of their Surprize, was by by a sick Child, which in the Room was calling to his Mother, and next answering, Coming; and she owns she heard a Rumbling in the Stable, but did not imagine but it was done by those that belonged to it, and so took no further Notice. But there was a third Coach, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's Stage-Coach, exceeding the former two in Value, which was not touch'd, by reason, 'tis believ'd, they suspected the Woman would give notice. But 'tis generally believ'd among those of the Hous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, that their Chief Aim was to rob the King's Best Coach, which was presented to His Majesty by their High and Mightinesses the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> they conjecturing That to be among the rest, which would have prov'd a very Considerable Booty; but the Fine Coach was singl'd to an adjoyning Room, which was divided by a Partition; and had they attempted the latter Coach door, which had but slight Glass-Windows over it, they would have found a more fecible Entrance than the former, but as Fortune favour'd, miss'd it. 'Tis to be observ'd that these Rogues made use of a Method very seldom Practised by Common House-breakers; For they took care to fling all the Chips behind the door within, proposing to themselves, that the Stables would not be visited by the Servants in no short time, and had brought along with them some House-Plaister, of the same Colour with That the doors had been wash'd with; and as it is to be seen, had with their Fingers wash'd over the Fraction they had made for Entrance, thereby conjecturing that it might so happen in a small space of time, the Loss of the Goods would be imputed to the Coachmen. But it happily fell out, that one of the Servants went to the Stable last <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> Morning, and found the Coaches robb'd; whereupon a strict En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was made among the Soldiers, who stood Centry, whether they had seen any one approach near the Stables? To which an inferior Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer answered, That they might as well have been robb'd in the day-time, for they were seldom look'd to of late, which sounded like a very fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous Excuse; for day and night there are Guards conti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ally standing on every side, especially in the night, the Gates being shut, 'tis next to an impossibility for any one to come in without their knowledge; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is peremptority believed it was conniv'd at amongst themselves.</p>
            <p>The Loss is computed to be upwards the Vallue of 30 <hi>l.</hi> and 'tis humbly presumed, that whosoever takes care to stop such Goods, if they come to be offered to Sale, will be well rewarded; they being left in Charge of the Lady <hi>Overkerk,</hi> who is lately gone to <hi>Holland.</hi>
